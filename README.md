- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kutz-Dag
- <!-- full name is Kutbudien, but call me Kutz --->
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript. My goal is to achieve full-stack development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming projects. <!-- in the future, obviously --->

Kutz-Dag/Kutz-Dag is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes. I am not used to GitHub by the way. I really hope to find a place where I could learn how to use it better.
