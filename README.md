ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kutz-Dag
<!-- full name is Kutbudien, but call me Kutz --->
## Current Goals

My goal is to achieve **full-stack development**.
I am currently a junior frontend developer. 

## What do I already know?

HTML:
```HTML
<p>I know HTML</p>
```

CSS:
```CSS
p {
  color: red;
  margin: 0 auto;
  }
```

JavaScript:
```JavaScript
let something = "This is something and" + x;
```

*I am also familiar with:*
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* SASS
* ES6, HTML5, CSS3, etc.
* React and Redux


```HTML
<!-- I am planning to add as much as possible to the list above -->
```


> I am currently busy with React.js
So far, this is my progress:
- [x] I understand the basics
- [x] I have created a project with it
- [x] I have created many projects with it

*And now after a while, I can add these to the list*
* Git
* Shell/Bash Scripting
* SQL
* PostgreSQL
* Docker

// Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on programming projects. <!-- in the future, obviously --->

### CodePen page
This link will take you to my [CodePen page](https://codepen.io/kutzz)

<!---
Kutz-Dag/Kutz-Dag is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes. I am not used to GitHub by the way. I really hope to find a place where I can learn how to use it better.
