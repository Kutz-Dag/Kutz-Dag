- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kutz-Dag
- <!-- full name is Kutbudien, but call me Kutz --->
## Current Goals
My goal is to achieve full-stack development.

## What do I already know?

```HTML
<p>I know HTML5</p>
```

```CSS
p {
  color: red;
  margin: 0 auto;
  }
```

```JavaScript
let something = "This is something and" + x;
```

> I am currently busy with React.js
- [x] I understand the basics
- [x] I have created a project with it
- [ ] I have mastered it

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming projects. <!-- in the future, obviously --->

Kutz-Dag/Kutz-Dag is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes. I am not used to GitHub by the way. I really hope to find a place where I can learn how to use it better.
